#
# --- FILE FORMATTING RULES ---
#
# 1. Section: Rules are organized into sections, indicated by a name in square brackets [specialWords].
#
# 2. Comments: Any line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment and is ignored by the system.
#
# 3. Rule Format: Each rule is a key-value pair defined as:
#      key = "value"
#
# 4. Key (Left side of '='): The key is the Romanized input word or sequence to be matched.
#
# 5. Value (Right side of '='): The value is the desired output, which must be enclosed in double quotes ("").
#
# 6. Mapping Types:
#    - Roman to Roman mappings: The value is a modified Roman spelling. These are pre-transliteration substitutions.
#      Example: 'nam' is replaced with 'naam' to enforce the long 'a' vowel sound.
#
#    - Roman to Devanagari mappings: The value is a direct Devanagari word. This is for irregular words or exceptions
#      that should not follow the standard transliteration rules.
#      Example: 'shuddha' is directly converted to 'शुद्ध'.
#
# 7. Special Characters: Characters like '/' can be used within the value for special logic in the transliteration engine.
#    Example: 'ta/raaii' where / breaks letters length to ta + raaii.
#
# --- RULE SECTIONS ---
#
[specialWords]
# This section contains direct substitutions for specific words.
# The transliteration process will check these rules first.

# roman to nepali mappings
# TO DO: cleanup repeated words and remove  a from phonetic halanta ending sounds. 
# anuswara and chandrabindu containing words should be rechecked.
