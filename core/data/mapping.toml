# --- SECTION: Core Transliteration Mappings ---
# These sections define the fundamental character-to-character mapping rules
# that the transliteration engine uses. The engine will look up Roman sequences
# in these maps to convert them to Devanagari.

# This section maps Roman vowels, symbols, and numbers to their Devanagari equivalents.

# Vowels and Diphthongs:
# Maps common Roman vowel sequences to their corresponding Devanagari vowels.

# Maps a single Roman consonant + 'a' to a full Devanagari consonant sound.
